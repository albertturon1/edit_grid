## 2026-01-21: Completed Task 1.1 - Create TableMutations and TableDataSource interfaces

### What was done:
- Created `src/lib/table/types.ts` with the following interfaces:
  - `TableMutations` - Pure mutation functions with optional updateCell, rows (add/remove/duplicate), and columns (add/remove)
  - `TableSourceMetadata` - filename and firstRowValues from imported file
  - `CollaborationInfo` - isReconnecting and users array for real-time collaboration state
  - `TableDataSource` - Discriminated union type with loading/error/empty/ready states

### Verification:
- `bun tsc` - PASSED
- `bun unit` - PASSED (2 tests)
- `bun e2e` - PASSED (12 tests)

### Notes for next person:
- Phase 1 is now COMPLETE. You can proceed to Phase 2 (Refactor Y.js Hooks).
- Recommended next task: Task 2.1 (Create useYjsMutations hook) - this refactors useTableContextMenu to use pure function signatures matching TableMutations interface.
- The types are designed to match the existing useTableContextMenu patterns but with primitive parameters instead of ExtendedContextMenuPosition.
- The CollaborationInfo type imports RemoteUser from @/lib/collaboration/types to maintain consistency with existing collaboration types.
